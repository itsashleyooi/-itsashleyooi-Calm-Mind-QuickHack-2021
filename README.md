#### Project background

Due to the current pandemic situation, more people are suffering from mental health illnesses. Even before the pandemic, about <u>30% of population in Malaysia</u> suffered from anxiety and/or depression. 

Here some of the statistics of mental health of adolescents in Malaysia:

**CALM MIND** is an interactive platform opened to all students with the aim of motivating students when times are hard as well as forming a new community based on the topic of the day. Through this platform, students are free to share their interests, ideas and current thoughts with other students.
